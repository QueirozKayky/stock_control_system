🚀 Project Title: Stock Control System

📝 Description

This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) Inventory Management System developed in Python. This project was built to practice and demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, particularly the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) model, input validation, and data structuring using dictionaries and lists.

This application simulates a basic stock control for a small business, managing item IDs, names, and quantities.

✨ Features (What it Does)
The program provides the following core functionalities:

Create (Register): Allows the user to register a new item by providing a name and quantity. Automatically assigns a unique ID.

Read (List): Displays all items currently stored in the system in a clean, column-aligned report format.

Delete (Remove): Allows the user to search for an item by its ID and remove it from the stock list.

Update (Planned): Future feature to modify item quantities (TBD).

Input Validation: Robust error handling to ensure users enter valid, non-negative numbers for quantity and selection.
